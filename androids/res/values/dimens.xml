    <!-- Minimum span needed to begin a touch scaling gesture.
     If the span is equal to or greater than this size, a scaling gesture
     will begin, where supported. (See android.view.ScaleGestureDetectorApi27)

     This also takes into account the size of any active touch points.
     Devices with screens that deviate too far from their assigned density
     bucket should consider tuning this value in a device-specific overlay.
     For best results, care should be taken such that this value remains
     larger than the minimum reported touchMajor/touchMinor values
     reported by the hardware. -->
